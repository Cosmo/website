[Rails World](/world/2025) is next week and we’d love to share with you all of the sponsors who are contributing to making this year’s edition a memorable event for the community. 

But first, some frequently asked questions: _Will there be a livestream? Will the talks be recorded? When will the talks be online and where can I find them?_

The answer to all of those questions: We will not offer a livestream for Rails World this year. Instead, we post the Opening Keynote quickly within 24 hours, and all of the other talks as they are ready over the following 2 weeks, You can find them all soon on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@railsofficial">Rails official YouTube channel</a>.

Now on to the sponsors:

**Platinum Sponsor: AppSignal**

For the third year in a row, <a href="https://www.appsignal.com">AppSignal</a> is the Rails World Platinum Sponsor. Since 2023 they have been at the very heart of the Rails World, bringing demos, sjoelen, fun, and stroopwafels.

This year they also created an <a href="https://www.appsignal.com/rails-world">Amsterdam Guide</a>, where you can find interesting activities and places to visit while in Amsterdam, the story of the Rails World venue, the Beurs van Berlage, and practical travel information.

**Closing Party & the Rails at Scale Summit: Shopify**

As a Gold Sponsor, <a href="https://www.shopify.com/">Shopify<a/> will have a booth in the Sponsor Lounge where attendees can connect with their Rails experts, stop by to discuss building and scaling applications at massive scale, get help unblocking tough technical challenges, or learn more about opportunities with Shopify’s engineering team.

Beyond the booth, Shopify is also the proud sponsor and host of the [Rails at Scale Summit](/world/2025/rails_at_scale). This one-day event, held the day before Rails World, will bring together 36 companies to share insights, challenges, and solutions unique to working at scale.

Shopify is further extending its support by sponsoring onsite interviews and post-production. This means that even those who can’t attend in person will be able to follow along throughout the day and catch up on sessions shortly after the conference wraps.
